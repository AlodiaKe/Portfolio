                            This was the first Digital Technology assessment of the year.
                            We were taught how to create python code for many different scenerios, eg. Digital library, even number counter, etc.
                            This assessment was about us creating a Python subject quiz for students to study.
                            We had to include questions and answers, alongside other interesting features.
                            The code displayed to the left was a while loop I created that would exit the user from a specific subject option they were being quizzed on.

                            For our second assessment of the year, we were tasked to create a web design for a blog.
                            My chosen blog was a movie blog, since I really enjoy watching movies and reading reviews myself.
                            We had to create mockups on Figma, and collect lots of feedback to improve our designs.
                            I am very proud of my final design, which you can find (alongside other concepts) by clicking the button below.

                            As preperation for this assessment, we did many practise tasks.
                            This pomegranate website was one of them; we were tasked to copy the layout and design of the Apple website.
                            This included navbars, footers, image placement, and many more.
                            I'm proud of my final result, and the button below will lead you to my pomegranate website.

                            This was our very first Product Design assessment of the year.
                            We were told to build a contraption that would stop an egg from cracking after being dropped from a great height.
                            Except there was one catch - The only material we could use was a sheet of A3 card, tape, and hot glue.
                            The image to the left is a concept/design I made for my project.
                            It includes a parachute and accordion legs to absorb the impact of the fall.
                            In the end, my egg ended up surviving the fall!

                            This is our final Product Design assessment, and I am currently working on it.
                            Over the course of 2 terms, we had to design, create mockups, and build a piece of flatpack furniture.
                            This was a tough challenge, as all pieces had to fit in a box with the dimensions 420 x 300 x 145 (mm).
                            I am creating an umbrella stand, and the coolest thing about it is that zero screws are required.
                            The image to the left is a model I made in Fusion360, with the stand in it's environment (my deck).
                            I am very proud of my work so far, and am predicting I will get an Excellence (If I can actually finish in time).
